## The homepage
The homepage lives in `/index.html`. Its components are contained in `/components/`.

## The articles
All the articles are contained in individual folders under `/stories/` (for example, `/stories/cast-of-characters/`). They have a shared set of components under `/stories/components/`.

## Deployment
1. Compress everything in the root directory (including folders) into a zip file. 
2. Publish as a new interactive using Ollie interatives uploader tool. Grab the published URL.
3. Republish the Ollie redirect under `/the-corruption-issue/` with the new interactive URL.
